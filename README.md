Beyond the blue event horizon.

Four score and seven years ago, our forefathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation.  Conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether this nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.  We are met upon a great battlefield of that war.
